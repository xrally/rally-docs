# Install Options


## Option 1: Install python package

```bash
pip install rally
```

!!! note

    may fail because of missing system packages.

## Option 2: Automated installation

The easiest way to install xRally is by executing its 
[installation script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/rally/master/install_rally.sh)

```bash
wget -q -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/rally/master/install_rally.sh | bash

# Or using curl
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/rally/master/install_rally.sh | bash
```

The installation script will also check if all the software required
by xRally is already installed in your system; if run as **root** user
and some dependency is missing it will ask you if you want to install
the required packages.

By default it installs xRally in a virtualenv in ``~/rally`` when
run as non admin user, or install system wide when run as root. One can
install Rally in a **venv** by using the option ``--target``:

```bash
./install_rally.sh --target /foo/bar
```

You can also install Rally system wide by running script as root and
without ``--target`` option:

```bash
sudo ./install_rally.sh
```


Run ``./install_rally.sh`` with option ``--help`` to have a list of all
available options:

```console
$ ./install_rally.sh --help
Usage: install_rally.sh [options]

This script will install rally either in the system (as root) or in a virtual environment.

Options:
  -h, --help             Print this help text
  -v, --verbose          Verbose mode
  -s, --system           Install system-wide.
  -d, --target DIRECTORY Install Rally virtual environment into DIRECTORY.
                         (Default: /root/rally if not root).
  --url                  Git repository public URL to download Rally from.
                         This is useful when you have only installation script and want
                         to install Rally from custom repository.
                         (Default: https://git.openstack.org/openstack/rally).
                         (Ignored when you are already in git repository).
  --branch               Git branch name, tag (Rally release), commit hash, ref, or other
                         tree-ish to install. (Default: master)
                         Ignored when you are already in git repository.
  -f, --overwrite        Deprecated. Use -r instead.
  -r, --recreate         Remove target directory if it already exist.
                         If neither '-r' nor '-R' is set default behaviour is to ask.
  -R, --no-recreate      Do not remove target directory if it already exist.
                         If neither '-r' nor '-R' is set default behaviour is to ask.
  -y, --yes              Do not ask for confirmation: assume a 'yes' reply
                         to every question.
  -D, --dbtype TYPE      Select the database type. TYPE can be one of
                         'sqlite', 'mysql', 'postgresql'.
                         Default: sqlite
  --db-user USER         Database user to use. Only used when --dbtype
                         is either 'mysql' or 'postgresql'.
  --db-password PASSWORD Password of the database user. Only used when
                         --dbtype is either 'mysql' or 'postgresql'.
  --db-host HOST         Database host. Only used when --dbtype is
                         either 'mysql' or 'postgresql'
  --db-name NAME         Name of the database. Only used when --dbtype is
                         either 'mysql' or 'postgresql'
  -p, --python EXE       The python interpreter to use. Default: /usr/bin/python.
  --develop              Install Rally with editable source code try. (Default: false)
  --no-color             Disable output coloring.
```

!!! note 

    the script will check if all the software required by xRally
    is already installed in your system. If this is not the case, it will
    exit, suggesting you the command to issue **as root** in order to
    install the dependencies.

You also have to set up the **sRally database** after the installation is
complete:

```bash
rally db recreate
```


## Option 3: Use Docker Image

First you need to install Docker; Docker supplies 
[installation instructions for various OSes](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

You can either use the official Rally Docker image, or build your own
from the Rally source. To do that, change directory to the root directory of
the Rally git repository and run:

```bash
docker build -t myrally .
```

If you build your own Docker image, substitute ``myrally`` for
``xrally/xrally-openstack`` in the commands below.

The Rally Docker image is configured to store the database in the user's home
directory - ``/home/rally/data/rally.sqlite``. For persistence of these data,
you may want to keep this directory outside of the container. This may
be done via 2 ways:

1) Rely on docker to create a volume, which is based on volume in image:
```bash
docker volume create --name rally_volume
docker run -v rally_volume:/home/rally/data xrally/xrally-openstack env create --name "foo"
```

2) Create manually volume and attach it to container.
```bash
sudo mkdir /var/lib/rally_container
sudo chown 65500 /var/lib/rally_container
docker run -v /var/lib/rally_container:/home/rally/data xrally/xrally-openstack db create
docker run -v /var/lib/rally_container:/home/rally/data xrally/xrally-openstack env create --name "foo"
```

!!! note

    In order for the volume to be accessible by the xRally user
    (uid: 65500) inside the container, it must be accessible by UID
    65500 *outside* the container as well, which is why it is created
    in ``/var/lib/rally_container``. Creating it in your home directory is only
    likely to work if your home directory has excessively open
    permissions (e.g., ``0755``), which is not recommended.

You can find all task samples, docs and pre created tasks at /home/rally/source
In case you have SELinux enabled and xRally fails to create the
database, try executing the following commands to put SELinux into
Permissive Mode on the host machine

```bash
sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=permissive/' /etc/selinux/config
setenforce permissive
```

xRally currently has no SELinux policy, which is why it must be run in
Permissive mode for certain configurations. If you can help create an
SELinux policy for xRally, please contribute!
